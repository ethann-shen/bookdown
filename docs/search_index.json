Using event data provided by Wyscout that covers one season of regular-season games from five European soccer leagues, we develop four velocity-based pace metrics and examine how pace varies across the pitch, between different leagues, and between different teams. Our findings show that although pace varies considerably, it is generally highest in the offensive third of the pitch, relatively consistent across leagues, and increases with decreasing team quality. In addition, we assess whether the pace metrics are useful in predicting the outcome of a match by constructing models with and without the metrics. After implementing hierarchical logistic and multinomial logistic models, we find that the pace variables are statistically significant but only slightly improve the predictive accuracy metrics.

In basketball, pace is defined as the number of possessions per 48 minutes (Ferrero, 2013). However, there is no standardized or generally accepted definition of pace in soccer. Pace has been defined as the number of shots taken (Knutson, 2013; Knutson, 2015) or the number of completed passes per game (Minkus, 2017). Both of these metrics can provide an idea of how fast the ball is moving. However, the main limitation of event-based pace metrics is their failure to appropriately account for the outcome or the circumstances under which they are performed. For example, evaluating pace as the number of shots taken does not account for the percentage of shots on target, while the number of completed passes does not differentiate between a pass made between two defenders in their own half of the pitch and a pass from a winger trying to create a goal-scoring opportunity. Pace-of-play has also been measured as the distance covered over time within a team’s possessions (Lawrence, 2015). However, short possession sequences do not provide an accurate measurement of pace. For example, a possession consisting of a goal kick and a pass may travel at a fast speed, but is not necessarily representative of a team’s overall pace. The main goal of this work is to explore possessions via pass velocities. This new perspective of pace-of-play analyzes possessions that consist of three or more pass or free kick events, as these types of events are more definitive of a team’s pace. The use of spatio-temporal event data allows for more granular measurements of pace-of-play, such as measures of speed between consecutive events and between different regions on the pitch. In addition, we aim to determine whether the pace metrics are useful in predicting the outcome of a match and whether those metrics are significant. Our research goals are three-fold: Examine how pace-of-play varies across the pitch, between different leagues, and between different teams. Quantify variations in pace at the league and team level and provide metrics to assess how well teams attack and defend pace. Evaluate the effectiveness of the pace metrics by incorporating them into models that predict the outcome of a match. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and data pre-processing steps. Section 3 provides the framework and evaluation of our pace-of-play metrics. Section 4 discusses the modeling methodology and results. Section 5 includes a discussion of our findings and future work. "],["data.html", "Chapter 2 Data 2.1 Processing the Data", " Chapter 2 Data There are three main types of data available for soccer analytics. The first type is similar to box score data, which provides the match outcome and statistics about each team’s performance, such as the number of shots taken and the number of corner kicks taken. Our analysis utilizes event data, which describes the events that occur during a match and provide the 2D coordinates of the ball at the start and end of these events. The third and most granular type is tracking data, which generally records the 2D position of all players on the pitch and the 3D position of the ball throughout the match. We utilize data collected by Wyscout, a leading soccer analytics platform. The data includes the 1,826 regular-season games played during the 2017-2018 season in five prominent European soccer leagues, including the English first division (EPL), the French first division (Ligue 1), the German first division (Bundesliga), the Italian first division (Serie A) and the Spanish first division (La Liga). Overall, this amounts to 3,071,396 unique events, for an average of 1,682 events per game. For each of the five leagues, the events data details all the events that occur during the course of each match. The data includes a number of variables that describe the event, including its name, time at which it occurs and its starting and ending coordinates. All the event and sub-event names can be found in Appendix Table 6.1. It also includes variables that identify the player, team, match, and match period (1st or 2nd half) that the event corresponds to; the player, team and match IDs are unique numerical values assigned by Wyscout. Both the x and y coordinates are always in the range [0, 100] and indicate the percentage of the pitch from the perspective of the attacking team, which is assumed to always play from the left side to the right side of the pitch (Pappalardo, 2019). The value of the x coordinate indicates the event’s nearness (in percentage) to the opponent’s goal, while the value of the y coordinate indicates the event’s nearness (in percentage) to the right side of the field. For consecutive events in which the ball stays in play and is possessed by the same team, the ending coordinates of an event will match the subsequent event’s starting coordinates. Wyscout’s data collection is performed by expert analysts that tag the events from match videos (Pappalardo, 2019). For each ball touch in the match, the analyst will add the event type, timestamp, and coordinates on the pitch. A series of quality control checks are performed, algorithmically and manually. Though these steps substantially reduce the margin of error, there is still potential for uncatchable mistakes. Table 2.1: Representation of a play consisting of 5 actions in a match between Arsenal and Leicester City. The end coordinates of Arsenal’s first pass matches the start coordinates of Arsenal’s second pass. Match ID Team Name Event Name Timestamp \\((x,y)_{start}\\) \\((x,y)_{end}\\) 2499719 Arsenal Pass 810.4485 (79.8, 15.4) (74.55, 29.4) 2499719 Arsenal Pass 811.5564 (74.55, 29.4) (77.7, 34.3) 2499719 Arsenal Duel 813.9146 (77.7, 34.3) (78.75, 49) 2499719 Leicester City Duel 814.0040 (27.3, 35.7) (26.25, 21) 2499719 Arsenal Shot 815.4620 (78.75, 49) (105, 39.4) Table 2.1 shows an example of five events in our data. This play consists of two consecutive passes, a duel on the ball, and ends with a shot taken by Arsenal. The teams data describes the clubs that play in the five leagues during the 2017-2018 season. This dataset contains the name of the club (e.g. Liverpool) and a team ID, which can be matched with the team-identifying variable in the events dataset. 2.1 Processing the Data The events and teams datasets, which are originally provided in JSON format, were transformed into data frames. We then merged the datasets by team ID so we also know the name of the club corresponding to each event. Before conducting our analysis, we made three substantial changes to the merged dataset’s coordinates and coordinate system. Although soccer pitch measurements are not standardized, the preferred size for most professional clubs is 105 by 68 meters; we opted to make our pitch dimensions 105 by 70 meters for ease of calculations. Thus, the rescaled x coordinates are now always in the range [0, 105] and the y coordinates are now always in the range [0, 70]. From this point onward, references to the coordinates will be in terms of the rescaled pitch size. Figure 2.1: Standard pitch measurements. All units are in meters. There were also inconsistencies with some of the coordinates, particularly with goal kicks and shots. The starting coordinates for goal kicks were initially recorded at either (0, 70) for the home team or (105, 0) for the away team. Neither of these coordinates is possible - goal kicks should start within the attacking team’s goal area, a 5.5 by 18.3 meter box centered at the goal-line. Thus, a goal kick’s starting x coordinate was changed to 0, and its starting y coordinate was sampled uniformly from the interval [25.85, 44.15], the y coordinates of the goal area. The ending coordinates for shots are initially recorded at either (0, 70) for the home team or (105, 0) for the away team. Once again, neither of these coordinates is realistic. Since the ending coordinates of the shot should match the starting coordinates of the following event, we assigned all starting y coordinates of the following event that are not 0 or 70 as the ending y coordinate of the shot, and changed the ending x coordinate of the shot to the starting x coordinate of the following event. This readjustment accounts for shots that are off-target or blocked by another player, but the ball still remains in play. The ending x coordinates for remaining all shots were changed to 105, since these shots are either saved by the goalkeeper or deflected out of bounds. For these shots, the starting y coordinate of the following event is either 0 or 70. If the shot is saved by the goalkeeper, we assume that the shot was on-target. Thus, the ending y coordinates for saved shots were sampled uniformly from the interval [31.35, 38.65], the y coordinates of the goal. If the shot went out of bounds, we assume that the shot was off-target. Thus, the ending y coordinate was sampled uniformly from outside the y coordinates of the goal but within the penalty box, or uniformly from the interval [14.85, 31.35] \\(\\cup\\) [38.65, 55.15]. Processing the JSON files and transforming the coordinates can be implemented with functions in the scoutr R package, a complete and consistent set of functions for reading, manipulating, and visualization Wyscout soccer data. "],["pace-of-play-metrics.html", "Chapter 3 Pace-of-Play Metrics 3.1 Framework 3.2 Results", " Chapter 3 Pace-of-Play Metrics 3.1 Framework 3.1.1 Possession Sequences Ball possession is the amount of time that a team possesses the ball during a game (Batorski, 2020). However, there is no widely accepted definition of what events conclude a possession and trigger a new one. Thus, we created a possession identifier that indicates the current unique possession in a game. In our definition, new possessions begin after a team demonstrates that it has established control of the ball. This occurs in the following situations: at the start of a half, when the team successfully intercepts or tackles the ball, after a shot is taken and after the opposing team last touches the ball before it goes out of bounds or commits a foul. A new possession can also begin even if the same team has possession of the ball. For example, if the ball goes out for a throw in for the attacking team, this indicates a new possession for the same attacking team. In addition, if the same team makes a pass after a sequence of duels, events in which opposing players contest the ball, this constitutes the same possession. According to our definition above, there was an average of 306 possessions per game. When analyzing pace, we only included passes and free kicks (excluding free kick shots and penalty kicks) since these events are reliable indicators of the pace of the game. In addition, we only kept possessions that consist of three or more pass or free kick events, as these types of possessions are more definitive of a team’s pace. From this point onwards, events will only refer to these passes and free kicks. Following the exclusion of certain possessions, the remaining possessions contained an average of 5.5 events per possession. 3.1.2 Metrics of Pace After creating a possession identifier, we first calculated the distance each event traveled. The east-west distances (\\(\\delta_{EW}\\)) are determined by the difference of the starting and ending x coordinates while the north-south distances (\\(\\delta_{NS}\\)) are determined by the difference of the starting and ending y coordinates. The total distances (\\(\\delta_{T}\\)) are calculated with the formula \\(\\sqrt{(\\delta_{EW}^2 + \\delta_{NS}^2)}\\). Events are assigned an E-only distance (\\(\\delta_{E}\\)) only if the pass travels toward the opposing goal. The major limitation with our distance calculations is that we assume the ball travels in a straight line from the start to end coordinates. In reality, passes rarely travel in a straight line and players will often dribble the ball before making a pass. However, the data does not provide information about the ball’s true trajectory and movement, so we are forced to make this assumption. Next, we calculated the duration between events. For each event, the data only provides a timestamp in seconds since the beginning of the current half of the game. Thus, within each possession, the duration for an event was calculated as the difference of the timestamp of the following event and that of the current event. With this definition of duration, the last event in the possession sequence is unable to be included in the calculation of pace. We used the distance traveled and duration between successive passes and free kicks in the same possession to calculate four different measures of pace: total (\\(V_{T}\\)), east-west (\\(V_{EW}\\)), north-south (\\(V_{NS}\\)), and east-only (\\(V_{E}\\)) velocity. \\(V_{E}\\) differs from \\(V_{EW}\\) in that only forward progress is measured, and any backward progress is excluded from the analysis. Note that these four metrics are the average velocities of the event rather than the instantaneous velocities, since we did not have access to tracking data. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the minimum number of events per possession, since a minimum of three events was an arbitrary choice. In Appendix Figure 6.1, we analyzed \\(V_{T}\\) across the five leagues using possessions that contained at least two and at least five events. Since the \\(V_{T}\\) is relatively similar across the three choices, we can verify that our results are not sensitive to this decision. 3.1.3 Spatial Polygrid Analysis We divided the pitch into 294 equal, non-overlapping 5x5 meter square polygrids (Yu et al., 2019). This is why we rescaled our pitch to 105 x 70 meters instead of 105 x 68 meters. \\(V_{T}\\), \\(V_{EW}\\), \\(V_{NS}\\), and \\(V_{E}\\) for a given event were assigned to all polygrids that the event’s path intersects. Each polygrid contains \\(n\\) velocity values for the \\(n\\) event paths that intersect it. For each of the 5x5 polygrids, we then take the median for each of the four different pace metrics. There are polygrids, particularly ones in the corners or along the attacking team’s goal line, that have very few recorded velocity values because only a few events intersect those polygrids. These polygrids often contain passes with extremely high velocities, most of which are due to tagging errors. Thus, the median was taken, instead of the mean, to account for the presence of outliers. 3.1.4 Zonal Analysis We divided the pitch into 8 regions. For each zone, we determined which of the 294 5x5 polygrids intersect the zone. As seen in Figure 3.1, there are some polygrids that fall into multiple zones. We then take the mean of the median \\(V_{T}\\), \\(V_{EW}\\), \\(V_{NS}\\), and \\(V_{E}\\) values of those 5x5 polygrids to determine the aggregate speeds for the zone. Figure 3.1: Plot of the 294 polygrids and 8 zones overlaid on the pitch. The grey lines represent the polygrids and black borders represent the boundaries of the 8 zones. This method was conducted in favor of another one that assigns an event’s speeds to all zones that intersect the path of the event. Our approach automatically factors in the event’s distance within the zone and is more resistant to outliers. For example, for a pass that intersects \\(n\\) different 5x5 polygrids in a zone, the zone’s aggregate speed will be affected by that pass’ speed \\(n\\) times instead of just once. All of the previously mentioned procedures in this section can be implemented with functions in the scoutr package. 3.2 Results 3.2.1 EPL Pace (Polygrid) We first examined how pace in the English Premier League (EPL) differs among the 294 polygrids on the pitch. Figure 3.2: Velocity by polygrid in the EPL for the 2017-18 regular season. Note that the scale of the four plots are different. Figure 3.2 displays the velocities for all games played in the EPL. \\(V_{T}\\) is the fastest in the polygrids within the opposing team’s penalty box and along the opposing team’s goal line. This is primarily due to higher \\(V_{NS}\\) in those areas, which mainly comes from corner kicks. Corner kicks often have a higher velocity than most passes, and since most corners are taken into the 6-yard box, their trajectories will intersect with the polygrids along the goal line. In the offensive half of the pitch, \\(V_{T}\\) is slower along the left and right flanks and faster in the middle. This is primarily driven by the patterns in \\(V_{EW}\\) and \\(V_{NS}\\). \\(V_{EW}\\) is faster along the flanks and slower in the middle, while \\(V_{NS}\\) displays the opposite pattern. However, since the scale of \\(V_{NS}\\) is larger than that of \\(V_{EW}\\), \\(V_{T}\\) is faster in the middle. From the \\(V_{E}\\), it seems like the teams in the EPL prefer to advance the ball past the center line along the flanks, rather than down the middle. At the end of the 2017/18 season, 8 of the top 10 assisters were most often deployed as either left or right wingers or midfielders. This suggests that goal-scoring opportunities are more likely to come from the flanks, and thus pace is expected to be higher in those regions. Another interesting result is that \\(V_{E}\\) is relatively similar in the offensive and defensive thirds. Forward attacking pace (\\(V_E\\)) is currently the most used metric of team-level pace (Harkins, 2016; Alexander, 2017; Silva, David and Swartz, 2018) but Yu et al. (2019) suggests that \\(V_E\\) is not an ideal metric for measuring a team’s offensive capabilities because there are diminishing returns for advancing the ball forward. However, this decline in speed is only apparent in the polygrids around the 6-yard box. In most cases, players who receive the ball in this position would shoot, as these positions provide players with the optimal shooting angles. However, \\(V_{E}\\) does not decline in other polygrids in the offensive third. Central midfielders stationed around the outskirts of the penalty box could pass the ball to wingers on the left or right flanks. Even though the shooting angle worsens for the wingers, they can easily advance toward the goal line and cross the ball into the penalty box or cut back (Caley, 2019) to an onrushing player, both of which could lead to goal-scoring opportunities. 3.2.2 EPL Pace (Zonal) We then examined how pace in the EPL differs among the 8 zones. Figure 3.3: Velocity by zone in the EPL for the 2017-18 regular season. Overall, the results from Figure 3.3 reflect the observations from the previous section. We confirm that \\(V_{T}\\) is the highest in zone 8 and approximately 28-37% slower in the other seven regions. This is primarily due to the disparity among the \\(V_{NS}\\), particularly in zone 8. \\(V_{EW}\\) is also roughly equal in all zones, which may have been hard to deduce from Figure 3.2. In addition, this confirms that \\(V_E\\) is generally consistent across the pitch, which provides further evidence against the results found in Yu et al. (2019). 3.2.3 Pace Across Leagues Next, we analyzed how pace varies between the EPL and the four other European, first-division leagues (Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A and La Liga). Figure 3.4: Percent difference in velocity by zone relative to the EPL for the 2017-18 regular season. Figure 3.4 shows the percent difference between the average velocities from the four other European leagues and that of the EPL. In Ligue 1, \\(V_{T}\\) is approximately 1% faster in zones 5, 6, 7, and is primarily driven by changes in the \\(V_{EW}\\), as \\(V_{NS}\\) is relatively similar to that of the EPL. This could be due to the fact that the average number of goals scored per game is slightly higher in Ligue 1 than in the EPL (2.72 vs. 2.68), as faster pace in the offensive half can yield more goal-scoring opportunities. In addition, the 2017-2018 season saw the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to PSG and the emergence of Kylian Mbappe. While Ligue 1 is often described as a poor attacking league, the advent of this formidable offensive duo may have reinvigorated the league’s attacking presence (Gibney, 2017). Differences in the offensive half are most notable in the Bundesliga. \\(V_{T}\\) in the Bundesliga is 2-4% faster in zones 5, 6, 7 and is driven by an increase in both the \\(V_{EW}\\) and \\(V_{NS}\\). The increase in \\(V_{T}\\) could have also been due to a higher average number of goals scored per game compared to the EPL (2.79 vs. 2.68). Additionally, Bundesliga players are more likely to create scoring chances and take more shots than those in the other four leagues (Yi et al., 2019), which is corroborated by the fact that the \\(V_{E}\\) in zones 5, 6 and 7 are approximately 3-5% faster than the EPL. Pace in Serie A is generally slower and primarily driven by a decline in \\(V_{EW}\\) across seven zones, with the most noteworthy decrease occurring in zone 1. In terms of raw velocity values, this difference is approximately 1 meter per second. Unfortunately, nothing in the data or the available literature provides any further insight on this phenomenon. In addition, the average number of goals scored per game in Serie A is the same as in the EPL, which could have contributed to the similarities in pace in the offensive half between the two leagues. La Liga displays the smallest difference in pace, with only slightly slower speeds in zones 1 and 2. We initially expected La Liga teams to have the slowest velocities in the defensive half, as they are known for playing out from the back, a common tactic in which teams begin passing in their defensive third. This type of build-up play can help increase the quality of passes into teams’ midfielders and forwards. Goalkeepers such as Keylor Navas of Real Madrid and Marc-Andre Ter Stegen of Barcelona both possess excellent ball control and distribution skills, which thus allows their teams to start plays from the back. In recent years, more EPL teams have been adopting this tactic. Manchester City, with goalkeeper Ederson, is one of the best teams at playing from out from the back. When Pep Guardiola took over in 2016, he seeked to implement a system that plays out from the back, which requires a goalkeeper who is comfortable with the ball at their feet (Tanner, 2018; Nalton, 2019; Robson, 2019). Although this style of play has a myriad of benefits, not all teams are capable of executing this tactic. Playing out from the back requires precise passes, as one wayward pass could fall into the feet of an opposing player. Some goalkeepers, such as Tottenham’s Hugo Lloris, arguably one of the world’s best goalkeepers in terms of anticipation and one-on-one situations, lack the ability to pick out the right passes and prevent their teams from adopting this tactic (Robson, 2019). The mixed success of playing out from the back in the EPL may have contributed to the slight difference in pace in the defensive half in comparison to La Liga. In general, players from La Liga and the EPL also display the most similar performance-related match actions (Yi et al., 2019) and recorded a similar average number of goals per game (2.69 vs. 2.68), suggesting that only slight differences in pace should be expected between these two leagues. 3.2.4 EPL Team-level Pace (Polygrid) We then examined team-level pace for the 20 teams in the EPL using both the polygrid and zonal methods and compared each team’s \\(V_{T}\\) to that of the EPL average. Figure 3.5: Polygrid analysis of total velocity by team vs. EPL average while attacking. Select teams are ordered by final standings from the 2017-18 season. All units are in m/s. Figure 3.5 displays the difference between the \\(V_{T}\\) in each 5x5m polygrid for 8 teams and that of the EPL average. None of these teams are faster or slower in all 294 polygrids, but the pace of the top six teams (Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal) is generally slower than the league average. As we move down the league table, the polygrid velocities display more variation, but the four lower tier teams are faster than the league average in more regions on the pitch. It might seem odd that the top tier teams have a slower pace, but this is primarily due to the way we define pace. We expect these teams to maintain possession for a greater portion of the game. It is more likely for teams to maintain possession when making shorter, more controlled passes. This led us to investigate the average distance per pass, which is found in Appendix Figure 6.2. We noticed that average distance, and therefore average velocity generally increased with decreasing team quality. In addition, goal kicks from the top four teams are relatively slower than the league average, with Manchester City’s having the slowest velocities. Although there is some variation, goal kicks from the bottom tier teams are generally faster than the league average. Since lower tier teams may not have possession for long periods of time, their goalkeepers may feel pressured to take longer goal kicks down the pitch, with the hope that one could create a goal-scoring opportunity. This is corroborated by the fact that Manchester City’s goalkeeper Ederson took 71% of his Premier League passes short, while every other goalkeeper, except for Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet, took less than 50% of their passes short (Spencer, 2017). Figure 3.6: Polygrid analysis of total velocity by team vs. EPL average while defending. Select teams are ordered by final standings from the 2017-18 season. All units are in m/s. Figure 3.6 shows that while defending, these 8 teams also display variability between different polygrids and regions on the pitch. The top six teams generally gave up more pace in the offensive zones, with the exception of Manchester United. One reason for this discrepancy could be due to Jose Mourinho’s leadership. Under Mourinho, Manchester United lined up in a 4-3-3 formation that shifts to a 4-1-4-1 defensively (Wright, 2018; Patzig, 2021). He is known for playing cautiously in big games; rather than imposing his style, he often looks to counter his opponents. For example, he has played 4-5-1 and 6-3-1 formations into draws against Liverpool, two defensive line ups that heavily negate Liverpool’s dynamic front three (Davies, 2016; Wright, 2018). In addition, Manchester United’s goal-keeper, David de Gea, was the best goalkeeper in the league with 18 clean sheets. The team-level attacking and defending velocities for the other 12 EPL teams can be found in Appendix Figures 6.3 and 6.4. 3.2.5 EPL Team-level Pace (Zonal) We also examined team-level pace using the zonal method, which allows us to get a more high-level understanding of how pace varies across different clubs in the EPL. Figure 3.7: Zonal analysis of total velocity by team vs. EPL average while attacking. Teams are ordered by final standings from the 2017-18 season. All units are in m/s. The overall results in Figures 3.7 and 3.8 verify those found in the polygrid analysis. The top six teams were consistently slower than the league average in all but 3 instances. As we move down the table, the zonal speeds display more variation, but these teams are generally faster than the league average. While attacking, teams such as Liverpool (4) and AFC Bournemouth (12) are faster than the league average in some zones and slower in other zones. However, the majority of teams are either faster or slower in all 8 zones. For example, Newcastle United’s (10) speeds are faster in all 8 zones, while those of Manchester City (1) are all slower. Figure 3.8: Zonal analysis of total velocity by team vs. EPL average while defending. Teams are ordered by final standings from the 2017-18 season. All units are in m/s. While defending, only Manchester City consistently gave up more pace, while the other 19 teams displayed variability between different zones. The top 6 teams generally gave up more pace in the offensive zones, with the exception of Manchester United (2). "],["modeling.html", "Chapter 4 Modeling 4.1 Variable and Model Selection 4.2 Hierarchical Logistic Model 4.3 Multinomial Logistic Model", " Chapter 4 Modeling 4.1 Variable and Model Selection After creating the pace-of-play metrics, we wanted to evaluate their effectiveness when used as variables in models that predict the outcome of a game. We implemented models with and without the pace metrics to determine if the models with the pace metrics achieve a higher accuracy. We only considered pre-game, historical variables that can be gathered before each game is played and did not include traditional post-game performance-based features, such as the number of shots or corners taken. Even though we incorporate a pace metric from the same game as a variable, we anticipate that they can be made into pre-game variables by substituting our pace metrics with historical measurements of pace. Table 4.1: Description of modeling variables. Variable Description Values Response FTR Outcome of a game with respect to home team -1 (Loss), 0 (Draw), 1 (Win) Predictors Unbeaten Current home unbeaten streak (win/draw) 0 to 19 Derby Indicates if game is a derby 0 (No), 1 (Yes) League League that game takes place in EPL, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A, La Liga Team Name of the home team Liverpool, Barcelona, etc. For each of the 1826 games, the response variable, FTR, describes the outcome with respect to the home team. A FTR of 1 indicates that the home team won while -1 indicates the away team won. Unbeaten is the home team’s current unbeaten streak leading up to a game. The streak resets to 0 when a team loses at home. For the first home game of the season, a team’s unbeaten streak from the 2016-17 season is used. For example, Manchester City went unbeaten in their last 12 home games in the 2016-17 season, so their Unbeaten for their first home game is 12. For the 14 newly promoted teams, their Unbeaten for their first home game is 0. This is because they played in a lower division, so their home unbeaten streak is not comparable to that of a team that played in the first division. Derby is an indicator variable, where 1 indicates whether or not a game is a derby game. A game is marked as a derby game if the two teams are located in the same city (Manchester City vs. Manchester United) or if there is a historical rivalry (El Clásico). League specifies which of the five leagues the game takes place in and Team provides the name of the home team. Table 4.2: Description of pace variables. Variable Description Values \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{AZ}\\) Sum of the differences in total velocity for all zones (1-8) for home team \\(i\\) and away team \\(j\\) -88.93 to 67.72 (m/s) \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{OZ}\\) Sum of the differences in total velocity for all zones in offensive half (5-8) for home team \\(i\\) and away team \\(j\\) -80.68 to 45.55 (m/s) \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) Sum of the differences in total velocity for zones 5,7,8 for home team \\(i\\) and away team \\(j\\) -79.1 to 39.74 (m/s) For each game, we conducted a zonal analysis of the \\(V_{T}\\) for the home and away teams. We took the median of the median velocities of the 5x5 polygrids to determine the aggregate speeds for each zone instead of the mean of the medians. Lower tier teams have a smaller number of recorded events per game and are more susceptible to outliers in both the polygrid and zonal analyses. Thus, using the median of the median velocities makes these zonal speeds more resistant to outliers. Then we calculated the difference (home - away) in \\(V_{T}\\) for each of the 8 zones. Let \\(i \\in (1, 2, \\dots, 98)\\) represent the home team and \\(j \\in (1, 2, \\dots, 38)\\) (\\((1, 2, \\dots, 34)\\) for teams in the Bundesliga) be the \\(j^{th}\\) game team \\(i\\) plays during the season. Then \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{AZ}\\) is the sum of the differences for all 8 zones, \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{OZ}\\) is the sum of the differences for the four zones in the offensive half (5-8) and \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) is the sum of the differences in the flank zones (5, 7, 8). To evaluate the models, we first split the data into a train and test set. The test data, which is 21.5% of the full data, includes 2 home and 2 away games for each of the 98 teams, for a total of 392 games. We perform 4-fold cross validation on the training data and lastly assess model performance by predicting on the testing data. We propose two different types of models - the first is a hierarchical logistic regression model that predicts between wins and non-wins (draws and losses) while the second is a multinomial logistic regression model that predicts on all three potential match outcomes. Draws and losses are the baseline category of the response variable in the hierarchical logistic models and losses are the baseline in the multinomial logistic models. These models were preferred over other classification algorithms since we are concerned with both predictive power and interpretability. For both sets of models, we first constructed a baseline model that only uses the predictors mentioned in Table 4.1. We then added one of the pace variables from Table 4.2 to determine if the addition of a pace variable improves the model’s accuracy. Only one pace variable can be added to the model since they are all highly correlated. Interaction effects between the baseline predictors and quadratic terms for Unbeaten and the pace variables were also considered, but none of these modifications significantly improved the predictive power of any model. We used accuracy and AUC as evaluation metrics for the hierarchical logistic regression and accuracy and True Positive Rate (TPR) for the multinomial logistic regression. Model assumptions and diagnostics, such as binned residual plots, are discussed in the Appendix. 4.2 Hierarchical Logistic Model The baseline hierarchical logistic model (without any pace variables) is as follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y_{ij} \\sim Bernoulli(&amp;\\pi_{ij}) \\\\ log(\\frac{\\pi_{ij}}{1-\\pi_{ij}}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} * Unbeaten_i \\ + \\beta_{2} * I(&amp;Derby_{ij}=Yes) + \\alpha_{i} &amp;&amp; (1.1)\\\\ \\alpha_i \\sim N(0,\\tau^2) \\end{aligned} \\] The modified hierarchical logistic model (with the pace variable) is as follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y_{ij} \\sim Bernoulli(&amp;\\pi_{ij}) \\\\ log(\\frac{\\pi_{ij}}{1-\\pi_{ij}}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} * Unbeaten_i \\ + \\beta_{2} * I(Der&amp;by_{ij}=Yes) +\\beta_3 * \\Delta_{ij}^{FZ} + \\alpha_{i} &amp; (1.2)\\\\ \\alpha_i \\sim N(0,\\tau^2) \\end{aligned} \\] Recall that the baseline of the response variable is draws and losses. \\(Y_{ij}\\) is the outcome (win vs. draw/loss) of the game and \\(\\pi_{ij}\\) is the probability that home team \\(i\\) wins the game. \\(\\alpha_i\\) represents the random intercept term for team \\(i\\). We do not include a random intercept for League, as most of the variability between leagues is already explained by the variability between teams. The only difference between models 1.1 and 1.2 is the addition of the variable \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) in 1.2. Table 4.3: Hierarchical logistic model results with 4-fold cross validation. Train Data Test Data Model Mean Accuracy Mean AUC Accuracy AUC Baseline 58.29% 56.53 63.52% 60.57 \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) 59.91% 58.52 64.29% 61.68 The baseline hierarchical logistic model reports an accuracy of 63.52% and AUC of 60.57 on the test data while the best performing pace model, the one with \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\), reports a slightly higher accuracy of 64.29% and AUC of 61.68. This suggests that the addition of a pace variable does not significantly improve the predictive power of the model on the test set. The results for the other two pace models can be found in Appendix Table 6.2. We expect the pace model with \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{AZ}\\) to have the lowest performance out of the three pace models. These pace variables assume that pace across the pitch is weighted evenly. Even though pace varies in the defensive half of the pitch, these differences are not necessarily indicative of a team’s scoring capabilities. Variation in pace in the offensive half is more indicative of a team’s attacking strength, which is more directly related to the outcome of a match. Table 4.4: Coefficients obtained from models 1.1 and 1.2.

All the coefficients, except for Unbeaten in the baseline model, are statistically significant. We note that the log odds for \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) is negative and statistically significant. This indicates that as the home team’s \\(V_T\\) in the flank zones increases by one meter per second, the odds of the home team winning the match is expected to multiply by 0.95, holding all else constant. This reflects the results from Figures 3.5 and 6.3, which showed that lower ranked teams, and thus teams that are expected to have a lower chance of winning a match, generally have a higher \\(V_T\\). 4.3 Multinomial Logistic Model The baseline multinomial logistic model (without any pace variables) is as follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} P(Y_{ijk} = k) = \\ &amp;\\pi_{ijk} \\\\ log(\\frac{\\pi_{ijk}}{\\pi_{ij1}}) = \\beta_{0k} + \\beta_{1k} * Unbeaten + \\ \\beta_{2k}* I&amp;(Derby_{ij}=Yes) + \\ &amp; (2.1)\\\\ \\sum_{T = 2}^{98}\\beta_{3kt}*I(Tea&amp;m_{i}=t) &amp; \\\\ k \\in (2, 3) \\end{aligned} \\] The modified multinomial logistic model (with the pace variable) is as follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} P(Y_{ijk} = k) =&amp; \\ \\pi_{ijk} \\\\ log(\\frac{\\pi_{ijk}}{\\pi_{ij1}}) = \\beta_{0k} + \\beta_{1k} * Unbeaten + \\ \\beta_{2k}* I&amp;(Derby_{ij}=Yes) + \\ &amp; (2.2)\\\\ \\sum_{T = 2}^{98}\\beta_{3kt}*I(Team_{i}=t&amp;) + \\beta_{4k} * \\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}&amp; \\\\ k \\in (2, 3) \\end{aligned} \\] Recall that the baseline of the response variable, \\(k=1\\), is a loss. \\(\\pi_{ijk}\\) is the probability that the game ends in a draw when \\(k=2\\) and a win when \\(k=3\\). For the term Team, \\(t=1\\) is the baseline, which is Manchester City. The only difference between models 2.1 and 2.2 is the addition of the variable \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) in 2.2. Table 4.5: Multinomial logistic model results with 4-fold cross validation. Train Data Test Data Model Mean Accuracy Accuracy Baseline 45.27% 45.15% \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) 45.23% 46.68% The baseline multinomial model reports an accuracy of 45.15% on the test data while the best performing pace model, the one with \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\), reports a slightly higher accuracy of 46.68%. This modified model, which is the best of the three pace models, actually performs slightly worse on the train set than the baseline model. Once again, we see that the addition of a pace variable in the model does not significantly improve the predictive power of the model. The results for the other two pace models can be found in Appendix Table 6.5. Table 4.6: True Positive Rates from the baseline and modified multinomial models for each match outcome. Train Data Test Data Model Mean TPR (win) Mean TPR (draw) Mean TPR (loss) TPR (win) TPR (draw) TPR (loss) Baseline 65.1% 16.55% 38.08% 69.64% 11.65% 39.67% \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) 64.61% 16.85% 38.38% 67.86% 13.59% 45.45% Table 4.6 indicates that the models predict wins decently well but struggle to predict draws and losses. On paper, one team is typically stronger than the other and thus more likely to win. Predicting a draw or loss requires one team to either perform better or worse than they normally do, which can be unexpected and therefore more unpredictable. Draws are considerably harder to predict than losses because this requires that both teams also score the same number of goals. Table 4.7: Coefficients obtained from models 2.1 and 2.2.

The log odds and odds ratios for the Team variable for both models can be found in Appendix Tables 6.6 and 6.7. Once again, we note that both the log odds for \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) are negative and statistically significant. This indicates that as \\(V_T\\) in the flank zones increases by one meter per second, the odds of the home team drawing a match versus losing are expected to multiply by 0.95 and the odds of the home team winning a match versus losing are expected to multiply by 0.94, holding all else constant. Both draws and wins are better outcomes than a loss, so this matches the results from Figures 3.5, 6.3 and Table 4.4. Teams with higher \\(V_T\\) are generally weaker and thus more likely to lose a match rather than draw or win a match. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 5 Conclusion 5.1 Future Steps", " Chapter 5 Conclusion Our findings show that although pace varies considerably, it is generally highest in the offensive third of the pitch, relatively consistent across leagues, and increases with decreasing team quality, though there is much more variability in pace among the bottom tier teams. This observation is most noticeable in a team’s goal kicks. Top tier teams may feel more confident playing out from the back and may be less likely to take longer goal kicks. On the other hand, bottom tier teams may struggle to maintain possession for a long time, so their goalkeepers may feel pressured to take longer goal kicks, with the hopes that one could lead to a goal-scoring opportunity. We also see that teams vary in their ability to attack and defend pace in different regions on the pitch. Forward attacking pace (\\(V_E\\)) is currently the most used metric of team-level pace (Harkins, 2016; Alexander, 2017; Silva, David and Swartz, 2018), but Yu et al. (2019) notes that \\(V_E\\) decreases drastically as teams move into offensive regions on the pitch and is thus not an ideal metric for measuring a team’s offensive capabilities. However, our findings show a contrasting result. \\(V_E\\) only declines in the polygrids in front of the goal, but not in other polygrids in the offensive half. Since \\(V_E\\) in the offensive half is also comparable to that in the defensive half, we believe that \\(V_E\\) is an appropriate metric to gauge team-level pace. Although we extracted meaningful findings from the pace metrics, there were limitations with the available data and methodology. The first is the presence of inaccuractely tagged events. Incorrectly labeled coordinates or timestamps can affect the calculation of the pace metrics. In addition, we assumed that the ball always traveled in a straight line, as we did not know the true trajectory of the ball or if a player dribbled the ball before passing. Another limitation is the lack of player tracking data, as this type of data is not widely publicly available. Player tracking data could provide more information about the true, 3D trajectory of the ball, thus giving us more robust and accurate pace metrics. Lastly, many of the explanations we provided for our results are hypotheses that we cannot fully verify. We are unsure if some of our results are simply due to noise in the data or if they actually hold across seasons. While the models performed adequately at predicting the outcome of a match, it is worth pointing out some limitations. We only had 1826 regular seasons in our dataset, so creating train and test sets further reduced the amount of data used to train the models. Another limitation is the lack of uncorrelated pre-game variabbles. We tried other variables, such as the number of points a team accumulated last season and the number of top 100 players that play for a team. Unfortunately, they were all extremely correlated with one another and the Unbeaten variable. We also considered variables such as the average age of a team’s players and the market valuation of a team’s players, but were unable to find these values on a game-by-game basis. 5.1 Future Steps The scope of this analysis discusses pace on a team and league level. However, pace can also be evaluated at the player-level. Future work includes quantifying player-level pace, since we would also have the location of all players on the pitch during the game, and evaluating passing networks using network analysis to determine a player’s value within a team and if that player’s value has changed across the season. We can also examine the impact of pace on events in the game, such as pace before a shot is taken and how pace impacts a team’s pass completion rate. Our models may perform better if we are able to incorporate data from across multiple seasons. This would not only provide more data to train the models on but could also help quantify heterogeneity across seasons, if included as a random effect in the hierarchical logistic model. We can also consider incorporating network-based variables. It may be interesting to consider other classification algorithms, such as a multinomial hierarchical logistic regression, or utilize a Bayesian approach to modeling.

Figure 6.6: Random effects for Home from pace hierarchical logistic model. The three assumptions for a hierachical logistic regression are linearity, randomness and independence. Linearity: Linearity is mostly satisfied. There are no obvious patterns in the plot of the binned residuals vs. Unbeaten or residuals vs. \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\). The average residuals vs. Derby are also all close to 0. However, the binned residuals vs. the predicted probabilities show a slight linear trend; as the predicted probability of winning increases, the residual also increases. This is one limitation with the hierarchical logistic models. Randomness: Our data utilizes all the regular-season games from the 2017-2018 season, and not a sample, so the randomness condition is satisfied. We also do not have reason to believe that this season’s games differ systemtically from that of other seasons. Independence: Even though the games are not completely independent, we believe that the independence condition is satisfied. Games in other sports, such as basketball, may be more dependent, since teams will often play back to back nights, and so fatigue or momentum may impact the second or third consecutive day of games. In soccer, teams will generally have one week in between consecutive regular-season games, which is plenty of time to rest. In addition, momentum in soccer does not necessarily exist on a game-by-game basis; even though a team may be on a win or unbeaten streak, it is hard to tell if that streak will continue, because soccer match outcomes are much more unpredictable than that of other sports. Quadratic terms for Unbeaten and the pace variable \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\) were also considered. Neither modification significantly improved the models’ performance or helped further satisfy the linearity condition. Figure 6.7: Binned residual plots for the baseline hierarchical logistic model.

Randomness and independence are satisfied, as the conditions for the multinomial logistic model are the same for the hierachical logistic model. Linearity: Linearity is satisfied. For all levels of the response variable (win, draw, loss), there are no obvious patterns in the plot of the binned residuals vs. predicted probabilities, binned residuals vs. Unbeaten or binned residuals vs. \\(\\Delta_{ij}^{FZ}\\). The average residuals vs. Derby and average residuals vs. Home are also all close to 0 for each level of the response variable.
